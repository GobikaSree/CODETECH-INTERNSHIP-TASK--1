Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset's characteristics, visualize distributions, understand relationships between variables, and identify any potential outliers.

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features measured for each sample:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica)
The dataset is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations based on Matplotlib.
Key Steps
Data Loading: The Iris dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Initial Data Overview: Basic statistics, data types, and missing values are examined.
Distribution Visualization: Histograms and KDE plots are used to visualize the distribution of each feature.
Pairplot Analysis: A pairplot is created to visualize relationships between features, differentiated by species.
Correlation Analysis: A correlation heatmap is generated to identify relationships between numerical features.
Outlier Detection: Box plots are utilized to identify outliers across different species.
Scatter Plot Visualization: A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between sepal length and width.
Insights
The analysis provides insights into the distribution of flower measurements and relationships between different species of Iris. The findings can inform further statistical analysis or machine learning tasks.

Getting Started
To run this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Conclusion
This EDA project serves as a comprehensive introduction to data exploration techniques and visualizations using Python. The insights derived from this analysis can guide further studies and predictive modeling efforts.
